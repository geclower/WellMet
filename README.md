Well Met!

This is a virtual walkthrough of The Met. The user can choose which department they are interested in and scroll through all items thatarein the public domain.

There is also a random button if they want to see a random work of art across all departments.

Each art piece is shown with an info tag including the title, the artist's name, the time it was made, and a link to The Met's page on the item in case they want more information.

Stretch goal for the future is to add in a catch for is there are too many requests that are not in the public domain.
