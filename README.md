Have you ever wanted to visit The Met but don't live in New York (or can't be bothered to go to the Upper East Side)? Welcome to Well Met! A virtual walkthrough of all public domain art available through The Met API.

## Description

This idea began from my interest in making all art as acessible as possible.

Users have the option to select their preferred department and browse through a comprehensive collection of items within the public domain.

Additionally, a randomized feature is available if the user preferres to see a random work of art across all departments.

Each art piece is accompanied by an informative tag including the title, the artist's name, the era or year of creation, and a link to The Met's dedicated page on the item in case the user is looking for further information. See pic below

## Help

Some departments have less items in the public domain than others. If a page takes longer than a few seconds to load a piece of art, it may simply be that no enough items in that department are avialable. Simply head back to the Departments page and choose a new selection, or click the Random Feature.
